# Sudoku

I have built this web application to put my C# skills to the test. This ASP.NET web application can generate a unique valid sudoku puzzle of four different difficulties.
Users can view their, other's or all play history on the "Statistics" page. A filter option for usernames is also available. 
Due to the responsive design, users can play anytime, anywhere with this application. Starting a puzzle on a computer and continuing on any other device is not a problem either.

**Key Features:**
* CRUD database
* Responsive design
* Sudoku puzzle generating
* Difficulty level option
* Play history viewing, filtering

**User manual:**
1. On the home page users can play, or generate a sudoku puzzle
2. On the statistics page the play history is available
